# Route Optimization in Python - Starbucks Example & Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based simulation for optimizing routes using real-world Starbucks locations. The goal is to find the most efficient paths between multiple Starbucks stores while minimizing distance and travel time.

## Features

- Uses **geospatial data** to analyze Starbucks locations
- Implements **route optimization algorithms**
- Simulates **real-world travel scenarios**
- Visualizes optimized routes using **matplotlib and folium**
- Employs **Python libraries** such as `geopandas`, `networkx`, and `osmnx` for spatial analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/route-optimization-starbucks.git
   cd route-optimization-starbucks
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.)*

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the simulation:

```bash
jupyter notebook Route_Optimization.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `geopandas`
- `networkx`
- `osmnx`
- `folium`
- `matplotlib`

## Visualization

The notebook generates route maps and visualizations to help analyze optimized paths between Starbucks locations.
